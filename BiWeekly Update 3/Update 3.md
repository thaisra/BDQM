# Contribution Description
The Linux and the Python skills that I learned throughout this week will be incredibly applicable to any further research projects,
since I am exploring these capabilities, especially with ASE. These provide the foundational groundwork for future endeavors,
so I will be able to utilize these skills in the future. 

# Literature Review
Paper: Ye, N., Yang, Z., Liu, Y. (2022). Applications of density functional theory in COVID-19 drug modeling. Drug Discov Today. 27(5). 

1). Summary: This paper discusses the applications and benefits of using molecular mechanics and specifically DFT in order to model drug and COVID-19
macromolecule interactions in order to better understand treatment options. 

2). Figure: I found figure 2 most interesting since it visually compares the QM/MM approach and the QM cluster models to each other. This allows for a 
better understanding of the differences between the two models as well as their similarities, and how one model builds upon the other for a more
precise visualization.

3). Strongest Point: One of the strongest points of this paper is evaluating and comparing different methods, such as the hybrid QM/MM and QM cluster
approach, allowing for the most accurate modeling. 

4). Weakest Point: In its current state, the paper does not predicting docking results of drug and viral interactions from non-covalent bonding.
Another weak point is the low feasibility of such complicated models due to high computational costs and thus decreased chemical accuracy,
which is something that future projects can improve on. 


5). Relation: This paper relates to our research project because it employs the same theory that our group does, but for a different application.
It can create a discussion across the larger scientific community about the usefulness and applicability of DFT, which can serve to increase
computational accuracy and effectiveness.
