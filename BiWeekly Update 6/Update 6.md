# Contribution Description
In this week, I ran practice DFT calculations which is exactly what real research in this field is based on, but on a much higher level.
This gave me an opportunity to practice with different functionals and also a better understanding of SPARC and ICE. 

# Literature Review
Paper: Wedal, J. Furche, F., Evans, W. (2021). Density Functional Theory Analysis of the Importance of Coordination Geometry
for 5f36d1 versus 5f4 Electron Configurations in U(II) Complexes. 60 (21).

1). Summary: This paper employs DFT to analyze the electronic structures of various U(II) complexes, focusing on the impact of
coordination geometry on their electron configurations. The study reveals that certain geometries, such as trigonal planar and square
planar, favor a 5f³6d¹ electronic ground state over a 5f⁴ configuration, highlighting the importance of ligand arrangement.
Additionally, the DFT calculations successfully predict the electronic properties and UV-visible spectra of these complexes, providing a theoretical
framework that can guide future experimental investigations.

2). Figure: Figure 6 is my most favorite, illustrating the calculated orbital energies for various U(II) complexes, specifically highlighting the energy levels
of the 5f and 6d orbitals. This figure is crucial in the context of DFT as it visually represents how the coordination geometry of the complexes
influences the relative energies of these orbitals, which in turn affects the electronic configuration of the complexes.

3). Strongest Point: One of the strongest points of this paper is its comprehensive analysis of the relationship between coordination geometry and electronic configurations
in U(II) complexes, which are supported by DFT calcs. By systematically exploring both known and hypothetical complexes, the study provides valuable insights
that can inform the design and synthesis of new low-valent f-block compounds, which could possibly increase our understanding of their electronic properties.


4). Weakest Point: The weakest part of this paper is its reliance on DFT calcs that may overlook complexities associated with e configurations and spin-orbit coupling
which is so prevalent in the f-block elements that the paper so deeply explores. Also, the paper focuses on theoretical complexes, and it could really use some 
experimental support for its theories. 


5). Relation: This paper relates to our research project because it explores the influence of coordination geometry on electronic structures, which expands our understandings
of how geometric factors influence e configurations in the f block. Also, this could lead us to explore how ligand environments and electronic properties in other elements interact,
contributing to the fields of computational chemistry and materials science.
